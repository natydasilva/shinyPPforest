## About

This repository contains a shiny app to replicate the visualization strategy in "Interactive Graphics for Visually Diagnosing Forest Classifiers in R".


The fishcatch data~\citep{fishcatch} is used to illustrate the shiny app characteristics. It contains 159 observations, with 6 physical measurement variables,
and  7 types of fish, all caught from the same lake (Laengelmavesi) near Tampere in Finland. There are 35 bream, 11 parkki, 56 perch, 17 pike, 20 roach, 14 smelt 
and 6 whitewish. The shiny app showing fishcatch data can be accessed at https://natydasilva.shinyapps.io/shinyppforest/
